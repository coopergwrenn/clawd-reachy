# Personalized Outreach Drafts — Ready to Send

## 1. Lindsay Mysior (@lindsaysjournal) — TikTok
**Priority: 🔥 HIGH — Perfect niche match**

**Subject:** Collab? Handwritten cards for your journaling audience 💌

Hey Lindsay!

Been watching your journal content — the way you mix storytelling with that nostalgic aesthetic is *chef's kiss*. Your audience clearly loves anything handwritten and analog.

I'm Cooper, founder of Yours Truly. We make handwritten postcards and cards using robots that write with real pens — not printed fonts, actual pen strokes on paper. Feels like something your community would genuinely love.

Would you be down to try a few? I'll send some your way, no strings. If you vibe with them, maybe we do something together.

Check it out: yourstruly.com

## 2. Journaling Dan (@journalingdan) — TikTok/Substack
**Priority: 🔥 HIGH — Pen pal enthusiast = PERFECT**

**Subject:** Fellow snail mail lover here 💌

Hey Dan!

Read your piece about pen pal culture and the art of sending real mail — you get it. In a world of DMs and emails, there's something special about handwritten notes.

That's exactly why I built Yours Truly. We use robots to write actual handwritten cards (real pen, real paper, real strokes). It's the closest thing to handwriting without the hand cramps 😄

I think your audience would genuinely appreciate it. Want me to send you a few to check out?

## 3. Penpal Kat (@penpalkat) — YouTube
**Priority: 🔥 HIGH — Pen pal content creator**

**Subject:** Something your pen pal community would love

Hey Kat!

Your pen pal content is exactly the vibe I love — bringing back the art of letter writing in a digital world.

I built Yours Truly to make handwritten cards accessible to everyone. We use robots that actually write with real pens — same feel as handwriting, just scalable. Perfect for pen pals, thank you notes, surprise letters.

Would love to send you some to try. No pitch, just think you'd genuinely appreciate them.

## 4. The Miner Family (@theminerfamily) — TikTok
**Priority: HIGH — Couple UGC, has email**
**Email: theminerfamily99@gmail.com**

**Subject:** Couple content idea — handwritten surprise cards 💕

Hey!

Love your couple content — you two have great chemistry on camera.

Quick idea: I run Yours Truly, where we make handwritten cards using robots with real pens. Think surprise love notes, "just because" cards, anniversary messages — all actually handwritten.

Could make for fun content: surprising each other with handwritten notes, unboxing reaction, etc.

Want me to send a few your way to try?
