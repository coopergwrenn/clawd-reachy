# UGC Creator Outreach Templates for Yours Truly

## Template 1: Stationery/Journaling Creators (HIGH PRIORITY)
*Use for: @lindsaysjournal, @journalingdan, @penpalkat, @foxandcactus, @shopvillabeautifful*

**Subject:** Collab? Handwritten cards that your audience would love 💌

Hey [Name]!

I've been following your content and love what you're doing with [specific content type - journaling/stationery/pen pal stuff]. Your aesthetic is exactly the vibe we're going for.

I'm Cooper, founder of **Yours Truly** — we make handwritten postcards and cards using robots that actually write with real pens. It's the perfect gift for people who love that personal, analog touch (basically your entire audience 😄).

I'd love to send you a few cards to check out. If you love them, maybe we could work together on some content? No pressure either way.

Here's a quick look: [yourstruly.com link]

Would you be down to try them out?

## Template 2: Lifestyle/Gifting Creators
*Use for: @alinaantman_nyc, @regina_ugc_, @theminerfamily*

**Subject:** Unique gift content idea 🎁

Hey [Name]!

Love your content — especially [specific post or style you noticed]. Your audience clearly trusts your recommendations.

I'm reaching out because I think you'd genuinely like what we're building at **Yours Truly**. We use robots to write real handwritten cards and postcards — not printed fonts, actual pen-on-paper writing. It's the perfect "thoughtful gift" content.

Would you be interested in trying some out? Happy to send a few cards your way, no strings attached. If you love them, we can chat about a collab.

Check it out: [yourstruly.com link]

Let me know!

## Template 3: Couple/Relationship Creators
*Use for: @theminerfamily, @austinandlexi*

**Subject:** Perfect content idea for couples 💕

Hey [Name]!

Your couple content is 🔥 — love how authentic you two are together.

Quick pitch: I run **Yours Truly**, where we make handwritten cards using robots with real pens. Think: surprise love notes, anniversary cards, "just because" postcards — all actually handwritten, not printed.

It's the kind of thing that makes for great unboxing content AND your audience would actually want to buy for their partners.

Want me to send you a few to try? Could be a fun video idea — surprising each other with handwritten notes or something.

Lmk!
