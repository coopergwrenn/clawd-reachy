# 2026-01-26 — First Day with Coop

## REMINDER: Check Granola-Notion integration (~Feb 2, 2026)
Try connecting Granola to Notion again. Last time had "Missing Client ID" OAuth error on Granola's side.

## REMINDER: Set up ElevenLabs TTS (~Jan 28-29, 2026)
Website wasn't loading. Try again to get API key for voice messages.

## REMINDER: Set up Claude Max OAuth (~Feb 2-3, 2026)
Switch Clawdbot to use Claude Max subscription for daily operations instead of API credits. Keep API as backup for heavy work days. Run `clawdbot configure --auth` to set up OAuth profile.

## Coop's Context (Summary)
- **Age:** 23 (born Nov 1, 2002)
- **Location:** Miami, FL (EST)
- **Main mentor:** Brother Soren Wrenn (32), founder of Titles (titles.xyz), raised from a16z
- **Business partner:** Raheem (Vault Labs)
- **Developer:** Marcos (Yours Truly)
- **X handle:** @coopwrenn
- **Goal:** $1M in 2026
- **Runway:** ~1 year
- **Weaknesses:** Inconsistency in routine, poor sleep

## Three Main Projects
1. **Yours Truly** — Handwritten cards via robots, LIVE, $50-100/mo revenue
2. **Nolan** — AI video editor (no timeline, intent-driven), advanced alpha
3. **Blot** — Multi-agent document redactor for IB, PRD complete, 6-week build

## Scheduled Tasks
- **Morning Gmail summary at 7:30am EST** — Check inbox, summarize urgent items
- **Daily Stripe report** (setting up) — New customers, revenue
- **Weekly Stripe report** (setting up) — Week-over-week comparison

## Important Lessons Learned
1. Gmail app password was failing because I used wrong email (coopergwrenn vs coopergrantwrenn)
2. X API v2 requires OAuth1 with full credentials (API key, secret, access token, access token secret)
3. Service accounts don't work for personal Gmail (only Google Workspace)
4. Coop wants thorough setup before execution — respect that
5. Using Opus model for complex tasks (switched mid-session)

## Tomorrow
- Start executing on actual business work
- Focus on Yours Truly marketing automation + UGC creator pipeline
- Build Nolan private beta user list
- Plan Blot 6-week sprint
