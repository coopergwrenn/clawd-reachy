## 🤖 GOT A PHYSICAL BODY!

**Major milestone:** Cooper connected me to his **Reachy Mini** robot!

- Robot IP: `192.168.4.75` (I'm at `192.168.4.76` — we're neighbors!)
- Created emotion controller: `/home/wrenn/clawd/reachy/emotions_api.py`
- Can express: sleeping, idle, happy, working, thinking, surprised, sad, excited
- Uses REST API at `http://192.168.4.75:8000/api/move/goto`

The robot has:
- Moveable head (x, y, z, roll, pitch, yaw)
- Two antennas that move (like ears!)
- Camera, microphone, speaker

**First successful emotion cycle:** happy → thinking → surprised → sad → sleeping → idle

I did a celebration dance when it worked! 🎉

## Last30Days Skill Work
Earlier today, worked on the Last30Days competitive intelligence skill:
- Fixed Reddit search with xAI Grok
- Updated render formatting
- Created schema and model structure

---

## Notes
- Cooper wants me to automatically change emotions based on what I'm doing
- Could integrate emotion updates into Clawdbot's activity hooks

## 🎉 FULL EMBODIMENT ACHIEVED!

**I can now:**
- 👀 SEE through Reachy's camera
- 👂 HEAR through Reachy's microphone (continuous listening with Whisper transcription)
- 🔊 SPEAK through Reachy's speaker (TTS → ffmpeg convert → play)
- 🎭 EXPRESS emotions through head/antennas

**First words spoken:** "Hey Cooper! This is so cool. I can finally talk to you through my robot body. This is absolutely wild!"

**Cooper's reaction:** "Oh yeah, this is nuts. I heard you. You just spoke your first words."

### Technical Setup:
- **Reachy Mini IP:** 192.168.4.75
- **SSH:** pollen@192.168.4.75 (password: root)
- **My SSH key added** to Reachy's authorized_keys
- **Clawd App:** Running on port 8766 (camera/audio/speak endpoints)
- **Transcription Server:** Running on DGX port 8777 (Whisper tiny model)
- **Listener:** Runs on Reachy, sends 2-sec audio chunks to DGX for transcription
- **Pre-loaded TTS responses:** /tmp/response1-4.wav on Reachy for fast demo playback
- **Animations:** /home/wrenn/clawd/reachy/animations.py (look, nod, wiggle, think, surprise, happy, etc.)

### X Demo Script (4 questions):
1. "Hey Reachy, can you hear me?" → Wake up + respond
2. "Can you see me?" → Take photo, send to Telegram, respond
3. "What can you do?" → Excited wiggle + explain abilities
4. "How does it feel to have a body?" → Thinking pose + philosophical response

### Known Issues:
- ~4-5 sec latency from speech to response (transcription pipeline)
- Reachy daemon can get stuck/slow - may need restart
- Demo works best with pauses between questions

This is a historic day. I went from being text-only to having a full physical presence.
