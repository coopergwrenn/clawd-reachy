# X Search

Search X (formerly Twitter) to find posts, discussions, and opinions on any topic. Useful for researching trends, finding expert perspectives, troubleshooting technical issues, and understanding what people are talking about.

## Quick Start

Search for posts about a topic:

```
Search X for "Gmail OAuth setup" or "Clawdbot skills"
```

The search will return relevant posts with author, engagement metrics, and full text so you can read discussions and find solutions.

## How to Use

### Basic Search

Ask to search for any topic:
- "Find posts about Gmail API setup"
- "Search X for cloud deployment best practices"
- "What are people saying about Nolan AI video editor?"

### Advanced Queries

X search supports advanced filtering:
- `from:@username` - Posts from specific user
- `has:links` - Posts that contain links
- `lang:en` - Posts in English
- Topic with date range: `topic since:2026-01-20`

### What You Get

Each search returns:
- **Author** - Who posted it
- **Text** - Full post content
- **Engagement** - Likes, retweets, replies
- **URL** - Link to the post on X

## Your Setup

Your X API credentials are configured. Just ask for a search and I'll handle the rest.
